### Welcome!

My group is involved in ab-initio modelling of various surfaces and nano-clusters as well as their interfaces. Currently, we focus on the modelling of the interface between transition metal based surfaces and nano-clusters for CO2 capture and its hydrogenation towards fuels. Moreover, we are modelling bimetallic systems for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. Furthermore, in collaboration with bio-technologist, we also theoretically investigate the interaction of biomolecules with nanostructures leading to the development of bio-compatible nano-structures for drug delivery and nanotherapy.

### About me

I am a DST-INSPIRE Faculty at the Central University of Punjab, working at the <a href="http://mme-428.ga/" target="_blank">Materials Modelling Lab</a>.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/en.html" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IWM</a> and <a href="https://uni-freiburg.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Freiburg</a>, Germany.
I have a Ph.D. in Physics from the <a href="http://hnbi.ac.in" target="_blank">Homi Bhabha National Institute</a>, India, where I worked with Prof. Arup Banerjee at <a href="https://rrcat.gov.in" target="_blank">Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology</a>.
I hold M.Sc. and B.Sc. (Hons.) degrees in Physics from the University of Burdwan.
