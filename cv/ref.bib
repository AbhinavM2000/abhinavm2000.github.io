Though such averaging techniques are widely used, the relative computational performance of various adaptations remains unknown. The accuracy and computational efficiency of two such models, one ensemble-averaging and one volume-averaging, addresses this issue. Results show that the relative computational cost of the methods depends upon the degree of bubble polydispersity. The ensemble-averaged model requires more quadrature nodes for broader population sizes and increasingly broad populations become computationally untenable. A moment-based method addresses this shortcoming. It uses a Gaussian closure and is augmented via long short-term memory recurrent neural networks for high-order statistics. Results show that this approach achieves small relative errors for even high-order statistical moments using only five degrees of freedom, significantly fewer than the hundreds required by classes methods.},

Volume-averaging is a deterministic process for which bubbles are represented in a Lagrangian framework as advected particles, each sampled from a distribution of equilibrium bubble sizes. Ensemble-averaging instead uses mixture-averaged equations in an Eulerian reference frame for the associated bubble properties, each represented by bins of the equilibrium distribution. In both cases, bubbles are modeled as spherical with dynamics governed by the Keller-Miksis equation. Computationally, there are tradeoffs between these two approaches. Here, we simulate an acoustically excited dilute bubble screen and compare the computational efficiency of the two approaches.},

    abstract = {This work focuses on the mechanical stability of three different capsule-viscous-flow-systems.  Red blood cells, which are often modeled as capsules, can form uniform trains when flowing in narrow confines; however, in less confined environments their flow appears disordered. This time-stationary system is analyzed through a nonmodal stability analysis which includes full coupling between the viscous fluid flow and elastic cell membranes. The linearization is constructed via a complex set of orthogonal small disturbances which are evaluated using boundary integral techniques. Transiently (t -> 0+) and asymptotically (t -> infty) unstable disturbances are identified, with their corresponding growth rates and perturbation conformations depending upon on the flow strength, viscosity ratio between the inner and exterior cell fluids, cell–cell spacing, cell at-rest shape, and vessel diameter. An ellipsoidal capsule subject to homogeneous shear flow is also considered. While this flow configuration is seemingly more simple, the base motion of the capsule is time-dependent, though periodic, rather than steady, requiring an extension of our methods. This capsule flow is known to display different kinematic behavior, depending on the flow strength, membrane material properties, and capsule shape. The stability of the capsule motion has been studied based on empirical observations of simulations; here we build upon these results though a direct stability analysis. Our analysis utilizes Floquet methods, which yields Floquet multipliers that classify the asymptotic stability of the capsule motion, and quantify how viscous dissipation will rapidly damp most disturbances. However, we also identify disturbances that decay slowly, over many periods of the capsules rotating motion, as well as neutrally stable perturbations. The last flow system considered here is a spherical capsule subject to large amplitude oscillatory extensional (LAOE) flow, which is often used to study the rheology and dynamics of complex fluids. Examining soft particles in LAOE is particularly challenging, partially due to the instability of the flow system. We again quantify this stability through linear analysis, here extending the aforementioned Floquet formulation to include nonmodal and intra-period effects. The analysis shows the asymptotic stability of the capsules for all flow descriptions, as defined by the relative flow strength and capsule time scale. Transiently unstable modes are found for all cases, though again their growth saturates quickly. We also identify an intra-period instability to capsule translations, which matches that of a rigid particle, though it does not have finite amplification from period-to-period.},

    abstract = {Bubble cavitation can induce such strain rates, and the resulting bubble dynamics are sensitive to the material properties. Thus, in principle, these properties can be inferred via measurements of the bubble dynamics. Estrada et al. (2018) demonstrated such bubble-dynamic high-strain-rate rheometry by using least-squares shooting to minimize the difference between simulated and experimental bubble radius histories. We generalize their technique to account for additional uncertainties in the model, initial conditions, and material properties needed to uniquely simulate the bubble dynamics. Ensemble-based data assimilation minimizes the computational expense associated with the bubble cavitation model. We test an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), an iterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS), and a hybrid ensemble-based 4D–Var method (En4D-Var) on synthetic data, assessing their estimations of the viscosity and shear modulus of a Kelvin-Voigt material. Results show that En4D–Var and IEnKS provide better moduli estimates than EnKF. Applying these methods to the experimental data of Estrada et al. (2018) yields similar material property estimates to those they obtained, but provides additional information about uncertainties. In particular, the En4D–Var yields lower viscosity estimates for some experiments, and the dynamic estimators reveal a potential mechanism that is unaccounted for in the model, whereby the viscosity is reduced in some cases due to material damage occurring at bubble collapse.},

    The inviscid Burgers' equation is considered as a step toward the formulation of such a method. Results are shown for linear and nonlinear numerical methods, including WENO shock capturing. Necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent and convergent solutions to the associated adjoint equation are discussed. The adjoint Euler equations are also investigated, for which no numerical schemes are provably convergent. A characteristic-based method for this problem is proposed. It transforms the adjoint equations into an uncoupled set of transport equations. These equations have the same form as the adjoint Burgers’ equation, and thus inherit their proven consistency properties.},
