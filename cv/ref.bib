 @article{Mondal_Banerjee_Fortunelli_Ghanty_2015, title={Does enhanced oxygen activation always facilitate CO oxidation on gold clusters?}, volume={36}, ISSN={0192-8651}, abstractNote={We investigate the catalytic activity of the subnanometer-sized bimetallic Au19Pt cluster for oxidation of CO via first-principles density functional theory calculations. For this purpose we consider two structurally similar and energetically close homotops of the Au19Pt cluster with the Pt atom occupying an edge (Td-E) or a facet (Td-S) site of a 20-atom tetrahedron. Using these homotops as catalysts we calculate the complete reaction paths and the thermodynamic functions corresponding to the oxidation of CO to CO2. It is found that the oxidation of CO on the Td-S isomer occurs through a smaller reaction barrier (0.38 eV) as compared with that on the Td-E isomer (0.70 eV), although the activation of O2 on the latter is much higher than that on the former. Therefore, a clear conclusion is that a higher O2 activation, which is generally believed to be the key factor for CO oxidation, solely cannot determine the catalytic efficiency of the Au-Pt bimetallic clusters. In addition, we find a stronger CO adsorption on the Td-E isomer (2.06 eV) as compared with that on the Td-S isomer (1.68 eV). Although stronger CO adsorption on the Td-E isomer leads to a higher O2 activation; however, high value of CO adsorption energy deteriorates the catalytic activity of the Td-E isomer towards the CO oxidation reaction.}, number={29}, journal={Journal of computational chemistry}, author={Mondal, Krishnakanta and Banerjee, Arup and Fortunelli, Alessandro and Ghanty, Tapan K.}, year={2015}, month={Nov}, pages={2177–2187}, keywords={CO oxidation; DFT; catalysis; gold cluster; oxygen activation}, language={en} }

It is observed that the Pd/PANI composite can capture and activate CO2 more efficiently than those for the cases of individual systems (PANI and Pd atom). Moreover, it is found that both PANI and Pd/PANI show high selectivity for the formation of formic acid (HCOOH) over the methanol (CH3OH) production. The electroreduction of CO2 towards formic acid (HCOOH) follows two different pathways, depending on the catalyst: on PANI the formation of HCOOH occurs through the *COOH intermediate, whereas for the case of Pd/PANI, the same reaction proceeds through the formation of formate (*OCHO). While the formation of CH3OH from CO2 on PANI is not feasible, electroreduction of CO2 towards CH3OH on Pd/PANI occurs through the formation of CO.}, number={9}, journal={Journal of molecular modeling}, author={Sahu, Amit and Mondal, Krishnakanta and Ghosh, Prasenjit}, year={2018}, month={Aug}, pages={248}, keywords={CO2 electroreduction; DFT; Formic acid; Heterogeneous catalysis; Methanol; Polyaniline}, language={en} }

Here, a unique member of efficient OER electrocatalysts has been developed based upon structurally versatile dumbbell-shaped ternary transition-metal (Cu, Ni, Co) phosphates with a three-dimensional (3D) (Cu2(OH)(PO4)/Ni3(PO4)2·8H2O/Co3(PO4)2·8H2O) (CNCP) structure. This structure is prepared using a simple aqueous stepwise addition of metal ion source approach. Various structural investigations demonstrate highly crystalline nature of the composite structure. Apart from the unique structural aspect, it is important that the CNCP composite structure has proved to be an excellent electrocatalyst for OER performance in comparison with its binary or constituent phosphate under alkaline and neutral conditions. Notably, the CNCP electrocatalyst displays a much lower overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a lower Tafel slope of 53 mV dec-1 with high stability in alkaline medium. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggested that the activity and long-term durability for the OER of the ternary 3D metal phosphate are due to the presence of electrochemically dynamic constituents such as Ni and Co and their resulting synergistic effects, which was further supported by theoretical studies. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the incredible OER execution was ascribed to the electron redistribution set off in the presence of Ni and Cu and the most favorable interaction between the *OOH intermediate and the active sites of CNCP. This work may attract the attention of researchers to construct efficient 3D ternary metal phosphate catalysts for various applications in the field of electrochemistry.}, number={5}, journal={ACS applied materials & interfaces}, author={Singh, Harjinder and Biswas, Rathindranath and Ahmed, Imtiaz and Thakur, Pooja and Kundu, Avinava and Panigrahi, Abhishek Ramachandra and Banerjee, Biplab and Halder, Krishna Kamal and Lahtinen, Jouko and Mondal, Krishnakanta and Haldar, Krishna Kanta}, year={2022}, month={Feb}, pages={6570–6581}, keywords={OER; bundle; dumbbell-shaped; electrocatalyst; ternary phosphate}, language={en} }
