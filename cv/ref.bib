  abstract = "Development of economical and high-performance electrocatalysts
              for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of tremendous interest
              for future applications as sustainable energy materials. Here, a
              unique member of efficient OER electrocatalysts has been
              developed based upon structurally versatile dumbbell-shaped
              ternary transition-metal (Cu, Ni, Co) phosphates with a
              three-dimensional (3D)
              (Cu2(OH)(PO4)/Ni3(PO4)2·8H2O/Co3(PO4)2·8H2O) (CNCP) structure.
              This structure is prepared using a simple aqueous stepwise
              addition of metal ion source approach. Various structural
              investigations demonstrate highly crystalline nature of the
              composite structure. Apart from the unique structural aspect, it
              is important that the CNCP composite structure has proved to be
              an excellent electrocatalyst for OER performance in comparison
              with its binary or constituent phosphate under alkaline and
              neutral conditions. Notably, the CNCP electrocatalyst displays a
              much lower overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA
              cm-2 and a lower Tafel slope of 53 mV dec-1 with high stability
              in alkaline medium. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
              analysis suggested that the activity and long-term durability for
              the OER of the ternary 3D metal phosphate are due to the presence
              of electrochemically dynamic constituents such as Ni and Co and
              their resulting synergistic effects, which was further supported
              by theoretical studies. Theoretical calculations also reveal that
              the incredible OER execution was ascribed to the electron
              redistribution set off in the presence of Ni and Cu and the most
              favorable interaction between the *OOH intermediate and the
              active sites of CNCP. This work may attract the attention of
              researchers to construct efficient 3D ternary metal phosphate
              catalysts for various applications in the field of
              electrochemistry.",

              (Pd/PANI) has been investigated employing ab initio density
              functional theory. It is observed that the Pd/PANI composite can
              capture and activate CO2 more efficiently than those for the
              cases of individual systems (PANI and Pd atom). Moreover, it is
              found that both PANI and Pd/PANI show high selectivity for the
              formation of formic acid (HCOOH) over the methanol (CH3OH)
              production. The electroreduction of CO2 towards formic acid
              (HCOOH) follows two different pathways, depending on the
              catalyst: on PANI the formation of HCOOH occurs through the *COOH
              intermediate, whereas for the case of Pd/PANI, the same reaction
              proceeds through the formation of formate (*OCHO). While the

              bimetallic Au19Pt cluster for oxidation of CO via
              first-principles density functional theory calculations. For this
              purpose we consider two structurally similar and energetically
              close homotops of the Au19Pt cluster with the Pt atom occupying
              an edge (Td-E) or a facet (Td-S) site of a 20-atom tetrahedron.
              Using these homotops as catalysts we calculate the complete
              reaction paths and the thermodynamic functions corresponding to
              the oxidation of CO to CO2. It is found that the oxidation of CO
              on the Td-S isomer occurs through a smaller reaction barrier
              (0.38 eV) as compared with that on the Td-E isomer (0.70 eV),
              although the activation of O2 on the latter is much higher than
              that on the former. Therefore, a clear conclusion is that a
              higher O2 activation, which is generally believed to be the key
              factor for CO oxidation, solely cannot determine the catalytic
              efficiency of the Au-Pt bimetallic clusters. In addition, we find
              a stronger CO adsorption on the Td-E isomer (2.06 eV) as compared
              with that on the Td-S isomer (1.68 eV). Although stronger CO
              adsorption on the Td-E isomer leads to a higher O2 activation;
              however, high value of CO adsorption energy deteriorates the
              catalytic activity of the Td-E isomer towards the CO oxidation
